TODO:
 o Memory
  - Fix reachable memory leaks, i.e., grammar
  - Add checks to reallocs in case of failure
 o Pipeline
  - Add init and destroy methods to ops and add loops to main
 o Copy phenotype and derivationTree
 o Elites

OLD_TODO:
 o Pipeline
  - Tie mapping, eval and replacement into pipeline
 o Initialisation
  - Sensible initialisation
 o Grammar
  - Symbol Pool
  - Clean up memory allocations from dynamic array allocation
 o Mapping
  - Mapped symbol codon index 
 o Genetic Operations
  - Operators/Operations for two point/sensible xo
 o Replacement
  - Everything
  - Elites
